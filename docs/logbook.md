# Logbook
Being in an environment where I am self-learning a lot of things at a very quick pace so it is 
important for me to be structured in my approach, not only in how I divulge the content, 
but also how I organize my workflow. 

As such, I have recently become obsessed with being mindful of my ability to preform. This
has driven me to start asking questions about my workflow:
1. What language do I use the most?
2. What language gives me the most trouble?
3. What does my schedule look like?
4. How long can I code before I need to Google?

Luckily, I use Wakatime to track my programming performance, and push all my code to GitHub. 
These two things, combined with the browser history I have, could provide a basis for a 
dataset that is very actionable.
